### Note to the reviewers:

Wish I had another day to add more test coverage.  That said, I think I got most of the major components in there.

## BitWatch
### The solution consists of three main pieces:
- CoinDeskAPI - A shared Framework that facilitates the outbound webservice calls to CoinDesk for BTC price data
- BitWatch App - The universal iOS app that displays the current and weekly BTC prices
- BitWidget - A Today Widget that displays the current BTC price

#### Fun Challlenge.  Appreciate the opportunity.  Thanks!
